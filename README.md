# Data-Sciences-Project
Built deep learning models to classify chili plant growth stages and detect leaf diseases using image datasets.

Performed data preprocessing, augmentation, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Compared multiple architectures including CNN, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and VGG.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.

Applied Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model interpretation.
